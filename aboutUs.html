            When it comes to finding a dependable auto mechanic in Wellington,
            look no further than Mid City Auto Repairs.<br />
            Initially located in Wellington central and owned by Clive Rowley
            (who still works with us today) Mid City Auto Repairs has been
            operating for 40+ years.<br />
            In 2020, we decided to move out of Wellington city to Petone as many
            of the industrial companies were moving away from the city centre to
            make space for residential apartments. It was also an opportunity to
            be closer to our suppliers and to have more businesses we could
            refer to. <br />In the same year, the business changed hands to
            myself, Jujhar Signh Dhillon. I had worked at Mid City Auto Repairs
            for 12 years; I always wanted to take over a workshop or to start my
            own business and looked forward to this new venture. <br />Fast
            forward to present day and we have a well-oiled auto shop, a great
            team of mechanics behind us, and customers who rave about our
            service and have been doing business with us for 40 years.<br />
            Don’t settle for second best when it comes to your vehicle. Mid City
            Auto Repairs offers you the highest standard in automotive repair
            services <br /><br /><br />“You can leave it to our experienced auto
            mechanics to ensure your car is running smoothly and safely. Your
            car can perform better and be safer on the road!”
